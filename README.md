# Cs121_cpp
imports certain standard libraries
name space pollution

tedious=rewriting the classes of a library in the same 
using name space standard. 
explicitly call out.
cout=counsel output
<< data flowing in and out. << flow to the output
>> directly data in a string
dont have to specify what data is coming in unlike c
stack stuff with strings and userinput, strings
do complex output easy
>> endl is end line.
unlike python which itsle puts us to a next line.
&a means refernce to x.
depending upon the language, we need to realise the differnce between pass by value and pass by reference
in C++, passing the value doesnt change the original value. passing by reference does.!
python compares 2 variables a==b, do they have the same value? 
in c++ the meaning is if they are pointing to same thing.

overloaded for stringa, = operator !we will prgram our owns in future!
different variables, same contant
documentation is horrific of random in c++
c std io , use random
